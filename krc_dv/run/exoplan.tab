Exo-planets information for KRC thermal calculation.
Each object must have 1 separation line followed by 10 lines to be read.
   This line should contain the set-number in this file.
Second  of 11 lines is object name, optionally within single quotes.
Next 9 lines must start with numeric values followed by a space, then anything.
All angles are in degrees. 
  
The 'Visual Magnitude of host star' and 'Distance from Earth' are used to
suggest the approximate Star/Sun 'solar constant' factor (ignores star spectral
 Type).  A parsec is 3.26156 LightYear 

Items commonly reported for exoPlanets that do not affect KRC
/ M sin(i) Minimum mass (in mJupiter) (only as effect on GRAVity)
/ planet radius
/ argument of periastron, omega, degree. Angle between direction to Earth and to
 periastron +90, deg.  Periastron is toward Earth (in the plane including the
 star, Earth and the orbit normal), and the probabilty of observing transit is
 highest, for omega=90 parsec= 2./(parallax in arcsec)
