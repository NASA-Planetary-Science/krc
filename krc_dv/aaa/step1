# Script and comments for making a distribution package of the KRC thermal
# model file system. See the file AAREADME for additional description
# Step 1 creates the distribution directory tree
# Note: these directories will contain largely soft links 
#   exception is aaa, which will contain a copy of the spource aaa directory

#_Hist 2006jan25 Hugh Kieffer Evolve from ROLO distribution system
# 2006jan25 Hugh Kieffer   Not running under Suse 9.3
# 2006apr12 HK Have running under Suse9.3
# 2009may11 HK Using CentOS 5.2 on 64-bit hardware
