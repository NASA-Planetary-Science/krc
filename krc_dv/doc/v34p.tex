\subsubsection{Notation} %..........................
Some notation here follows \qcite{Hapke93}, sections therein are indicated as
H[x.x] and equations by H(x.x) 
\qi $i$ is the incidence angle from the surface normal. $\mu_0 \equiv \cos i$
\qi $e$ is the emergence (viewing) angle from the surface normal. $\mu \equiv \cos e$
\qi $g$ is phase angle
\qi $\psi$ is the azimuthal angle between the planes of incidence and emergence 
\qi $\xi$ is a general azimuthal angle (used in integrals)
\\ Other symbols
\qi $I$ radiance, usually in the emergence direction
\qi $J$ irradiance, usually the incident power per unit are normal to the incidence
\qi $A_K$ the traditional KRC input albedo ``ALB''.

 ``TOI'' means ``Table of Integrals'' \qcite{Dwight61}

\subsubsection{KRC needs} %..........................

KRC needs two types of albedos; the fraction of collimated light hitting a
surface at local incidence angle $i$ that is reflected, and the fraction of
diffuse (presumed isotropic) light relected by a surface. KRC deals with energy,
so all photometric terms are assumed to represent the bolometric value, as
weighted by the solar spectrum.

Compute the absorbed direct, diffuse and bounce insolation in TLATS where it has
been done.  For thermal models, need an \textbf{absorption} photometric
function; equivalent to $1-A_H$ H[10.D].  KRC does not need the full BRDF.

\subsubsection{Thrashing with Hapke} %..........................

BRDF == Bidirectional reflectance distribution function, H[10.B]. Commonly a
function of the incidence angle relative to the surface normal, $i$, $e$ and
$g$.

$A_h$ == Directional-hemispherical reflectance (or hemispherical reflectance) is
the integral of the BRDF over all viewing directions. Equivalent to the ratio of
the total power scattered into the upper hemisphere to the collimated power
incident on the same area, H[10.D.2]. This can be a function of incidence
angle.

$A_s$ == Bi-hemispherical reflectance (or spherical reflectance) is the
reflectance of a surface under diffuse illumination, H[10.D.4]. It has no
geometric dependence.

Prior to KRC v3.3, all albedoes were considered to be Lambertian.  

In general, Hapke uses $r$ for ``reflectance'', however, there are many of them.

A potential source of confusion is the KRC treats ``albedo'' as the reflected
fraction of power incident on a unit area; this incident power is $J \cos i$
where $i$ is the incident angle relative to the local surface normal. Thus,
``albedo'' has no units. However, Hapke generally uses reflectance as the
fraction of incidence irradiance that is reflected, which is different by a
factor of $\cos i$ .

He defines $r$, the bidirectional reflectance, at the bottom of page 261 by:
``The incident radiant power [collimated] per unit area of surface is $J \mu_0$,
and the scattered radiance is $Jr(i,e,g)$, where $r(i,e,g)$ is the bidirectional
reflectance of the surface.'' [10.B]

The ratio of the reflectance of a surface to that of a perfectly diffuse surface
under the same conditions is $\frac{\pi}{\mu_0}r(i,e,g)$ H(10.3)

Also: H[8.E.1] starts with ``the scattered radiance $I(i,e,\psi)
=Jr(i,e,\psi)$.
The scattering of light from a (planar) surface is in general described by its
bidirectional-reflectance distribution function (\textbf{BRDF}) or
$r(i,e,g)/\mu_0$ H(10.1).

Whatever the photometric function, it should obey reciprocity.

The incident power (no atmosphere) on a surface is $\mu_0 J = S_m \cos i $
\\ The reflected fraction is $A_h(i)$ and the absorbed power is $S_m \cos i \left(1-A_h(i) \right)$


In Hapke terminology of his Table 8.1, the two albedos KRC needs are the:
\qi  $r_h \equiv r_{dh}$ or ``hemispherical albedo'' or hemispherical reflectance, =$A_h(i)$ H(10.33) 
\qi spherical reflectance, his $r_s$, my $A_S$. 

I found Hapke to have many similiar reflectance terms that are not needed 
here, and the normalization is obscure.  Here, I will simply treat the
reflectance $r(i,e,\psi \ \mathrm{or} \ g)$ as the relative radiance into
direction $e,\psi$ for an irradiance from direction $i$; and heuristically
determine the normalization required by KRC.

H[10.D.2] has ``The general expression for hemispherical reflectance is
$r_h(i)= \frac{1}{\mu_0} \int_{2 \pi} r(i,e,g) \ \mu \ d\Omega_e $ H(10.10) 
\qi where $d\Omega_e = \sin e \ d e \ d \psi$ .

 H[10.D.4] has ``the spherical reflectance is $r_s= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{2 \pi}  \int_{2 \pi}  r(i,e,g) \ \mu \ d\Omega_e  \ d\Omega_i $ H(10.21)

\subsubsection{Procedure here} %.........................................
We shall (must) assume that the planar surface has no preferred orientation;
that is, its reflectance is invarient under rotation of the surface abouts its
normal relative to the scattering plane.

Apparently what Hapke means by $\int_{2 \pi} d\Omega_e$ includes a normalization
of $1/2\pi$, although I did not find where he stated this.  Here the
hemipherical and spherical albedo will be used to establish any normalization
factors needed by KRC.

If $ r(i,e,\psi)$ does not involve $\psi$ (or $g$), which is true for the simple
photometric functions considered here, then the integration over $\psi$ or $\xi$
simply results in a factor of $2 \pi$

Desire that the ALB used in KRC retain its historic meaning of the fraction of
energy reflected by the surface. By conservation of energy, this can never
exceed unity, so must scale some of the results here for $A_H(0)$ and $A_S$. See
table in \S \ref{all},

% \pagebreak
% \large
\subsubsection{Lambert}
  A Lambertian surface by definition has the same radiance when viewed from any
  direction, and that radiance scales with $\cos i$. Thus $A_H$ must be
  independent of $i$. However, here develop the mathmatical formalities to be
  used for other photometric function.

\subsubsection{Lunar-like}
\qcite{Keihm84} does not list a BRDF, but has hemispherical albedo (his equation A5): 
\qb A(\theta)= 0.12+0.03 \left( \theta/45\right)^3 + 0.14 \left( \theta/90\right)^8 \qe

\qcite{Vasavada12} measurements with Diviner led to the form: 
\qb A(\theta)= A_0 +0.045 \left( \theta/45\right)^3 + 0.14 \left( \theta/90\right)^8 \qe

In both cases $\theta$ in degrees is equivalent $i$ in radians. See Appendix \S
\ref{LA} for background.

Implimentation in KRC 34 is a slightly more generalized form:

 \qbn A_H(i)= A \left( 1. + x \left( \theta /45\right)^3 + (0.14/0.12) \left( \theta /90 \right)^8 \right) = A \left( 1. + x \underbrace{ (\frac{4}{\pi})^3}_{f3} i^3
+  \underbrace{ \frac{0.14}{0.12}( \frac{2}{\pi})^8}_{f8}  i^8 \right)   \qen

Thus $x=0.25$ yields Keihm and  $x=0.375$ yields Vasavada for $A=0.12$.

Each of these relations has hemispherical albedo decreasing as insolation
becomes more oblique; Lommell-Seeliger is close to $cos^{0.3} i$ from 0 to
45\qd; see Fig. \ref{hem55n} and \ref{hem55c}. $A_H(i)$ increases with $i$ for
all models here. All but Lambert and high-k Minnaert have the property of
becoming larger than 1 at high incidence angles, so that the absorped power can
become negative for reasonable values of ALB, see Figure \ref{hem55a}. The only
practical way to prevent such a creation of energy for all photometric models is
to invoke a lower limit of 0 on adsorbed insolation; TLATS restricts $0 \le A_H \le 1$ .

\subsection{Code in KRC} %...................
Version 3.4 does not allow photometric functions when there is an atmosphere
because of input parameter overloading.

The use of $A_H$ and $A_S$ is shown in \S \ref{fffd}

SALB is $A_S$ and is a constant for a case.

Frost is always considered Lambertian

Each photometric function is normalized to unity at normal incidence, so that
the midday temperatures for low thermal inertia would be the same. The same
scaling is applied to the spherical albedos. Thus, the absorbed flux, using the
traditional KRC input parameter \nv{ALB}$\equiv A$ :
\qi Collimated: $(1-A P_f) \cos i$ where $P_f = A_H(i)/A_H(0)$ and

\\ If not atm., twilight forced to zero
\\ Compute $\mu_0$ (angle onto flat terrain)
\qi If twilight, adjust $\mu_0$
\\ If slope, compute $i_2$; no consideration of twilight
\qi compute $\alpha$ and $G_1$
\\ Compute hemispheric albedo of the surface, based in [adjusted]  $\mu_0$
\qi If Far, frost albedo is thick-deposit value based on Tfar, as have no frost-amount.
\\ Compute C=Collimated beam and boundary fluxs; use DE if an Atm.
\\ Compute D=Diffuse, which does not depend on slope
\\ Compute B=Bounce flux.
\\ Sum C+D+B at each time

If twilight:
\qi flux onto top of atmosphere unchanged, so atm heating should not be changed
\qi diffuse flux out bottom of atm is extended by cos3
\qi total energy should not change, so need to scale [C+D] by their diurnal sum.


Delta-Eddington always uses the Lambert albedo, otherwise becomes complex
(undefined) to consider the twilight region. Thus, surface photometric fuction
considered only for Collimated beam. However, frost is always treated as
Lambertian.

\subsection{A word about frost albedo}
 Frosts are considered to be Lambertian, although the albedo may depend upon the
 mean diurnal insolation. The frost albedo is set at the start of each season in
 TLATS, has no dependance upon $i$ (time of day), is not changed in TDAY and
 therefor is constant throughout a season. The effective albedo of a frost is
 based on transparency to the underlying albedo, also Lambertian, using the
 columnar-mass extinction coefficient FROEXT, which is evaluated each time-step
 in TDAY.

Albedo has two parts: $A_H = A_0 P_H$; and can apply separately to three locations:
\qi the ``target'' (flat or tilt or pit) surface for which T is being computed
\qi the ``region'' for Bounce and Diffuse fluxes, flat or tilt ?
\qi the surface under a  delta-Eddington atmosphere 
\qii For simplicity, assume this is the same as region.
\\ Conditions may be: no atmosphere or with atmosphere; then frosty or not.
If there is frost on target,  then $A_0=$ AFNOW = frost albedo at start of current season (may depend upon mean insolation)
\qi else  target $A_0=$ ALB.

 If there is not a fff, then decision of regional frost or not can only be based
 on the current frost flag. If there is a fff, in theory could use its
 temperaure to decide if region was frosty, but have no information on frost
 thickness. Thus only realistic choice is to assume regional frost condition is
 same as target.

Any place/time that is frosty, $P_H =1$.

 Delta-Eddington assumes surface is Lambertian, but KRC allows $\Delta$Edd lower
 boundary reflectance to follow $A_H$ for the selected photometric function. As
 of 3.4.4, input parameters do not allow non-Lambertian surface if there is an
 atm.; plan to remove this constraint in later versions.
