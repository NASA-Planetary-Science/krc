# krc
KRC is a computer program designed to compute surface and subsurface temperatures for planets and satellites with or without modest atmospheres. A single KRC run can handle complex subsurface physical properties for a global set of latitudes at a full set of seasons, with enough depth to capture the annual thermal wave, and to compute seasonal atmosphere condensation mass. Initially developed for Mars at the dawn of space exploration, there are generalities that allow this code set to be used for any solid body with any spin vector, in any orbit (around any star), with or without an atmosphere. The code is largely in FORTRAN and has evolved over 50 years and has been used extensively by the planetary science community.

KRC was developed by Hugh Kieffer with NASA funding. The web-site is maintained by Arizona State University, The interactive interface is supported by a Caltech, JPL, Northern Arizona University consortium.
